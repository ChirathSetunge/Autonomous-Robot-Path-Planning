## Introduction

This project addresses the challenge of finding the optimal path for an autonomous robot from a start to a goal position in a grid-based environment with obstacles. The solution leverages the A* algorithm, known for its efficiency and optimality in pathfinding tasks, especially in environments where cells may have different traversal costs[3][5].

## Algorithm Selection Justification

A comparative analysis was performed on A*, BFS, and DFS algorithms:

| Algorithm | Description | Dense Grid | Sparse Grid | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| A*        | Uses heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path; optimal and complete | Yes | Yes | O(E log V) | O(V) |
| BFS       | Explores all neighbors level by level; optimal for unweighted graphs | Yes | Yes | O(V²) | O(V) |
| DFS       | Explores as deep as possible before backtracking; not guaranteed optimal | No  | Yes | O(V+E) | O(V) |

- **A*** is chosen for its ability to guarantee the shortest path, efficiency via heuristic-guided search, and memory optimization through priority queues[3][5][1].
- **BFS** is only optimal for unweighted, simple grids and is less efficient in dense or large environments.
- **DFS** may not find the shortest path and can be inefficient in complex grids.

## Data Structures Selection Justification

- **Custom Cell Structure:** Each cell encapsulates coordinates, traversal costs, heuristic values, and state, enabling modular and efficient grid management.
- **Grid (2D Array):** Facilitates fast access and manipulation of cells, essential for path planning and obstacle placement.
- **Custom Priority Queue (Min-Heap):** Efficiently retrieves the cell with the lowest f-score (g + h), crucial for A*’s performance.
- **Custom ArrayList:** Used for flexible and efficient storage and retrieval of grid elements[1][5].

## Input Validation

Robust input validation ensures only valid grid dimensions and coordinates are accepted, preventing runtime errors and enforcing boundary constraints:

## Test Cases

**Basic Grid Tests (No Obstacles):**
- 10x10 grid, Start (1,1), Goal (9,9), 0 Obstacles
- Result: Goal reached in 17 steps, 0.004s

**Grid Tests with Obstacles:**
- 10x10 grid, Start (1,1), Goal (9,9), 30% random obstacles
- Result: Goal reached in 17 steps, 0.004s (path length may vary with obstacle density)

**Boundary Tests:**
- 10x10 grid with boundary barriers, only one path open
- Result: Successfully navigates complex paths with obstacles

## Results & Discussion

- The A* algorithm consistently finds the shortest path, even in the presence of obstacles and complex boundaries.
- The system demonstrates linearity and reliability, making it suitable for real-world autonomous navigation tasks[1][3][5].
- Increased obstacle density leads to longer optimal paths, highlighting sensitivity to environmental complexity.
